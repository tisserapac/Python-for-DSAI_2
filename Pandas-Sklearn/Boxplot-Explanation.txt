For Mobile Phone data set under Multivariate analysis, for discrete features I plot the box-plots. May I please know, from a box-plothow can we identify whether it is a good feature to use in our model training?

look at the mean of the box. 
Actually, the box plot and scatter plot is kind of the same. When you plot the scatter you want to see some trend. Box plot is the same.


The confuse is value of the box might not arrange in any order. You may need to arrange manually.

Anyhow, we want to see the differences between each values. For example, is 3 bathroom usually cost more than 1 bathroom.
But here you know 3 is more than 1.

How about, color of a car. Is white more expensive than red?

The box has 1 stripe which is a mean of the data in the value. If white is more expensive then red then we the strip of white will be higher than red.
